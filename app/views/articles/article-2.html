<p>For a while now, I’ve been looking for a data set I can really get into to help me learn a number of different tools. Going through this exercise can be fairly exhausting because data is rarely in a nice format, and that is assuming you can get your hands on some free, quality data. The majority of “bad” data I have encountered is bad because of missing values. A data set with messy values, containing strange characters or having values wedged between some text, can be frustrating but ultimately the information is there. Missing and unreliable data leaves few alternatives or options for improvement. Another important criterium of mine was the size of the data. A small data set may not include enough statistics to provide valuable insight, and even if it does the possibilities for analysis can be exhausted quickly. Finally, I wanted to look at information that is currently relevant and has predictive value going forward. All of these things lead toward sports, which is highly statistical and fits my goals.</p>
<p>Traditionally, baseball has been known as the statistical man’s sport because of its rich history of keeping records and the nature of the sport. Baseball is essentially a series of one on one match ups, between the pitcher and hitter, and future match ups can be assumed to have similar conditions as previous ones. Unfortunately for me, I’m not much of a baseball fan and have no plan to become one.</p>
<p>Basketball, however, has recently become a focus of sports analytics, in large part because of the amazing data that has been collected over the past few years. There are publicly available statistics going back decades as well as shot chart and play by play information for the last 15 years. This granular data has given analysts hope of breaking down a team game into meaningful nuggets of insight. Additionally, the 2013-2014 season marked the inaugural year of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stats.com/sportvu/sportvu.asp">SportsVu</a> technology throughout the NBA. SportsVu provides a system of cameras for analyzing every movement by every player on the court, using 6 cameras positioned throughout the stadium to take 25 pictures per second of the court. The initial data is remarkable and clearly points to the future of both NBA and sports analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, basic basketball data such as box scores and shot charts are not in an easy to obtain format and the SportsVu data is not open to the public. In the next few posts I’ll go through my efforts to obtain the data and look at the SportsVu system in a bit more depth to understand the possibilities of dealing with such a rich data set.</p>
